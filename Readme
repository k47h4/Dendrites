Figure 1:
run paper_model.py 
This script runs the balanced net and plots panels from Figure 1. This script can be easily run as it just runs the network once.

Figure 2-4:
These figures have been produced by running main_gating.py with different parameter configurations. Note: the simulations require a lot of time and disk space and runs many simulations in parallel.

Once main_gating has been run with the different gates and stored the data, 
plotFigure2.py plots the panels from Figure 2,
plotFigure3.py plots the panels from Figure 3,
and plotFigure4.py plots the panels from Figure 4. 

Figure S10:
memory_gating.py runs the network from Figure S10.
plotFigureS10.py plots the panels from Figure S10.
